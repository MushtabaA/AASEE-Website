                Based on guidelines outlined in the Alberta Science Curriculum, the activities are framed to nurture each studentâ€™s curiosity while ensuring that the concepts are based on items they are familiar with. We encourage science inquiry so that students ask questions, propose ideas, observe, experiment and interpret the findings they have gathered.
                AASEE volunteers, which comprise of University of Calgary graduate students and faculty, help guide these students during these hands-on activities. </p>
