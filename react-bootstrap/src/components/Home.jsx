              The Association for the Advancement of Science and Engineering
              Education (AASEE) seeks to inspire future science and engineering
              leaders. AASEE gives priority to diverse populations, namely
              Canadaâ€™s first nations peoples, girls, and those in financial
              need, as well as rural populations. We are mandated to work across
              the globe, and are implementing an ambitious plan. To do so, AASEE
              designs educational outreach workshops at the K-12 level and
              travels to specific schools and school boards. The lessons the
              volunteers teach are curriculum-relevant, hands-on activities,
              which are meant to engage the student, along with teachers. The
              Association for the Advancement of Science and Engineering
              Education is a registered charity in Canada.
