                Grande Prairieâ€™s Daily Herald-Tribune recently featured AASEE as it was beginning its trip to visit five schools in the city to promote and spark an interest in the fields of science and engineering. Beginning with the Swanavon School, Dr. Anis Haque, chairman and founder of AASEE, along with graduate students Leanne Dawson and Sarah Bannister from the University of Calgary, will offer a series of workshops from grades 3 to 11 on subjects including buoyancy, electricity, robotic arms, among others.
