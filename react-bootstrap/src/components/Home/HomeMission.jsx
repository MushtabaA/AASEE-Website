                        We are mandated to work across
                        the globe, and are implementing an ambitious plan. To do so, AASEE
                        designs educational outreach workshops at the K-12 level and
                        travels to specific schools and school boards. The lessons the
                        volunteers teach are curriculum-relevant, hands-on activities,
                        which are meant to engage the student, along with teachers. The
